## Description

Manage the legitimacy system at any time through the advanced options tab.

### Imperial System

- Add any faction to the Imperial legitimacy system.
- Dynamically set one of the factions to be the most legitimate or reset values.
- Instantly integrate the chosen faction into the most legitimate one, without needing to kill leaders or capture planets.
- Always see the Imperial legitimacy stats in the (gold) government display (EotH uses silver).
- Hero fighters and hero upgrades are available when their faction is integrated.
- Cheat: Start dark empire as any faction, any time before era 5.
- Cheat: Instantly unlock all research tech for eligible factions.

### Legitimacy Group Selector

- Toggle between random (default) and selectable group modes for finer control.
- Legitimacy group rewards are transferred when a faction is integrated.

**Random mode:**
- Unlock random legitimacy group heroes/rewards on demand.
- Options are: x1 or x10 for the most legitimate faction, and x1 for yourself.

**Selectable mode:**
- Pick and choose specific groups to unlock from one of the tiers.
- This prevents the AI from receiving legitimacy groups.

### Integration Rewards

Each Imperial faction has roughly one space reward per shipyard tier (light, heavy, capital, dreadnought, SSD)
and one ground reward per factory tier (barracks, light, heavy, advanced).
